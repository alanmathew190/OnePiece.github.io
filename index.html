                <p>One Piece is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It follows the
                adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, as he explores the Grand Line in search of the
                mythical treasure known as the "One Piece" to become the next King of the Pirates.
                It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its chapters
                compiled in 111 tankōbon volumes as of March 2025. The manga series was licensed for an English language release in
                North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media and in Australia by Madman Entertainment. Becoming a media franchise,
                it has been adapted into a festival film by Production I.G, and an anime series by Toei Animation, which began
                broadcasting in 1999. Additionally, Toei has developed 14 animated feature films and one original video animation.
